# Application to a conversion reaction ODE model


## Notes

* Please adapt the path to the `Boehm_JProteomeRes2014` folder. The files are provided in the ../model folder.
* When you have amici installed, before the first usage the sbml model will be compiled to the working directory. This step may be non working out of the box on some systems unfortunately. Consult the [amici documentation](https://github.com/icb-dcm/amici) for details.
