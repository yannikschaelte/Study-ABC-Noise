# Application to an agent based model of tumor spheroid growth


## Notes


* The tumor application requires an installation of the tumor2d package. This can be found on [github](https://github.com/icb-dcm/tumor2d) as well as in the `../model` folder. See the github package for an installation guide. The C/C++ package has been ported to python using swig and is thus easy to use.
