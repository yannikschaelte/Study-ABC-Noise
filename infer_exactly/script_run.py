"""
Illustrate the problem arising when not accounting for measurement noise.
Possible test cases: A deterministic model (-> ML estimator weighted by the
prior), and a simple SSA model (-> overestimation of parameters promoting
noise).

This means using a non-noisy model together with a deterministic acceptor,
and comparing that to the true analysis performed using either a noisy model,
or a stochastic acceptor.
