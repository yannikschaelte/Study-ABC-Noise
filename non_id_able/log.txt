### observations

no-noise = assuming no noise in the model

for [0, 1] noise (ok, maybe not biologically relevant):
- noise = 0.01 - 0.05: no-noise leads to concentration around wrong value, no probability given to true parameters any more
- noise = 0.1: no-noise does not even run through any more

for gaussian noise:
- 0.02: we see that no-noise need much longer, but
